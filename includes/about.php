                    </h2>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Roy Cruiser is built for those who don’t just travel—they take command of the road. Founded 5 years ago by Rajesh Roy, Roy Cruiser was born from a relentless passion for self-drive expeditions, extreme terrains, and borderless road journeys.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">What started as a personal obsession has evolved into a battle-tested adventure brand. With 250+ guided self-drive expeditions, 3,000+ road-driven travelers, and over 3,00,000 kilometers conquered, we’ve pushed machines and mindsets across mountains, deserts, jungles, winters, and international borders.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                    We specialize in self-drive road trips, hardcore self-drive expeditions, overlanding journeys, and cross-border convoy drives—engineered for explorers who want freedom backed by discipline. Every expedition is led by experienced expedition leaders, supported by tight convoy protocols, detailed route planning, and relentless on-ground support.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    Our signature benchmark drives include the iconic Bengaluru to Ladakh self-drive expedition, the brutal Winter Spiti drive, the Namaste Nepal cross-border self drive road trip, and Jungle Book wildlife conservation expeditions.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Beyond expeditions, Roy Cruiser also curates customized road trips, corporate offsites, and special interest journeys, tailored to suit individuals, families, groups, and organizations. Whether you’re chasing adventure, bonding with your team, or ticking off a bucket-list drive, we design journeys that match your spirit.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Powered by a passionate team and driven by the belief that great journeys change people, Roy Cruiser goes the extra mile—literally and figuratively—to deliver unforgettable travel experiences.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    We are proud Asia and India Book of Records holders for organizing the largest cross-border self-drive convoy, and for executing Asia’s first EV road expedition—proof that we don’t chase records, we redefine what’s possible on the road.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    If the road tests limits, Roy Cruiser leads from the front.
